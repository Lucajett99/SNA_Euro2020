## Social Network Analysis project A.A. 2022-2023

This is a report in which we analyzed the networks structure of football teams and how it affects the team's performance. This work focuses on the last UEFA Euro 2020 tournament. By analyzing the network created from the passes of the player, we tried to show that increasing the intensity and decreasing the centralization of a network leads to a better performance. We also applied a qualitative analysis which has the purpose to show how analyzing the network structure of a team could be useful in improving the team's performance and to apply countermeasures to the opponent's style of play.
